Course Project
==============

for "Getting and Cleaning Data", Coursera, John Hopkins University
------------------------------------------------------------------

The script ´run_analysis.R´ covers the required steps of the project in the following order:

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each
variable for each activity and each subject.

Each one is conveniently label in the scripts and extensive comments are included to be able to follow the code step by step.
As output a text file named `yX_avg.txt` is produced containing the tidy data set.
